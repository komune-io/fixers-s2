## Finite State Machine
In the theory of computation, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. This is in contrast to a Moore machine, whose (Moore) output values are determined solely by its current state. A Mealy machine is a deterministic finite-state transducer: for each state and input, at most one transition is possible.

## Concept

### Automate

### State

### Context

### Guard

current state + command = new state

### Transition

## Automate for Domain Driven Disen

### Aggregate

CommandEntryEvent
CommantErrorEvent
CommantGuardEvent
CommantExitEvent

StateContextEntyEvent
StateContextErrorEvent
StateContextExitEvent

CommandSnapEvent
GardSnapEvent
ContextEntrySnapEvent
ContextExitSnapEvent
