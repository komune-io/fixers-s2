### Finite State Machine (FSM) Concepts

- **Automate**: The system or process operating based on predefined states and transitions.
- **Transition**: The movement from one state (or model) to another due to an event or command.
- **State**: A condition or situation the system is in at a particular moment, which can change in response to commands and events.

### Command
A directive to change the system, triggering a transition from one state (or model) to another.

### Event
An occurrence representing the result of a command, marking a state transition within the FSM.

### Model
The encapsulation of the current state and its associated data in the FSM, which evolves over time.

### Decide
The process of determining which event or transition occurs in response to a command, based on the current state.

### Evolve
The update process where the model transitions from one state to another after an event is applied.

### React
The system's response to external stimuli, typically initiating a state transition based on a command.

### Event Sourcing
A pattern in FSMs where state transitions are captured as events, and the current model is reconstructed by replaying these events.

### State Storing
A pattern in FSMs where the current model is stored and directly updated through transitions without replaying past events.
